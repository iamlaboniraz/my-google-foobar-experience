Google Foo Bar is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. 
There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges.

I've triggered the prompt twice by searching for "python list comprehension". Each time, the page split open to reveal the message, "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?"

I already finished all level except level 5.
