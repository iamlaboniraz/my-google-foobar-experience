[Google Foo Bar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. 
There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges.

I've triggered the prompt twice by searching for "python list comprehension". Each time, the page split open to reveal the message, "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?"

# My Challenge Questions

The challenge consists of 5 levels consisting of algorithm problems. It was really a great experience so far. The first few levels were relatively easy, but as the levels peaked up, the difficulty gained heights.

Currently I am on level 5 and just have one more label to go.

# Level 1
1. Solar Doomsday([Solar_Doomsday.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level01_Solar_Doomsday.py) | [Solar_Doomsday.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level01_Solar_Doomsday.txt))
# Level 2
1. Power_Hungry([Power_Hungry.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level02_01_Power_Hungry.py) | [Power_Hungry.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level02_01_Power_Hungry.txt))
2.En_Route_Salute([En_Route_Salute.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level02_02_En_Route_Salute.py) | [En_Route_Salute.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level02_02_En_Route_Salute.txt))
# Level 3
1. Prepare_the_Bunnies_Escape([Prepare_the_Bunnies_Escape.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level03_01_Prepare_the_Bunnies_Escape.py))
2. Find_the_Access_Codes([Find_the_Access_Codes.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level03_02_Find_the_Access_Codes.py) | [Find_the_Access_Codes.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level03_02_Find_the_Access_Codes.txt))
At this point, I was offered to send my solutions to a Google recruiter. Checkout the questionnaire.md for details.
3. Fuel_Injection_Perfection([Fuel_Injection_Perfection.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level03_03_Fuel_Injection_Perfection.py) | [Fuel_Injection_Perfection.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level03_03_Fuel_Injection_Perfection.txt))

Completing level 3, I had to submit my personal details with a potential recruiter for a future interview. The Google Foobar is presumably still hiring and its needed to submit solution either in Python or Java. I donâ€™t know about the future upcomings for this, but to be honest I really enjoyed the challenges. Looking forward to solve more.

# Level 4
1. Free_the_bunny_Prisoners([Free_the_bunny_Prisoners.py](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level04_01_Free_the_bunny_Prisoners.py) | [Free_the_bunny_Prisoners.txt](https://github.com/iamlaboniraz/my-google-foobar-experience/blob/master/level04_01_Free_the_bunny_Prisoners.txt))
